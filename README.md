# How to recreate this template, and where I got the code
## Intro
The following project is not a course but also is not a simple bug fix or solution to common questions. This is everything that I've learned while building many websites while using a Vue and Vuetify frontend and a Fireabse (server-less) Backend.

Therefore there are many things you'll need for `setup only` and many skills you'll need to use `everyday` in your development. I will be tagging the important parts with the tags like this:
> **SETUP SKILL**

> **EVERYDAY SKILL**

in order for you to know that the skill following, will benefit you and/or should be memorized.

# Local Setup
## Go to the terminal or cmd on your Personal Computer

  * Nagivate to your project directory `Projects/[vue-firebase-template]` and create a web directory
      * I like to have my website in a `web` directory, for convenience, the [Github repo](https://github.com/mcmullinboy15/vue-firebase-template) doesn't have one but everything is in the main directory. You can clone it into your `web` directory
      ```  
        mkdir web && cd web
      ```


## Creating Vue App
1. 

## Things to install if you're not using my template

```
npm install --save axios
```

* [The GITHUB](https://github.com/savvyapps/SAVuegram)
* Vue
  * how components can work (.vue)
  * data, computed, methods
  * vuex, all needed map...
  * router
  * axios



  Start over with 
  ```
  vue create web && cd web
  ```
  ```
  vue add vuetify
  ```

setup all pages, with `vuetify` using `vuex`  just not as complex
